- Load all frames from TIFF files. We have to write our own loader for this to
  happen--just like we did for GIF images--because Imlib2 does not support
  multiple frames. Issue #241.
- Add support for more embedded thumbnail formats. Right now, sxiv seems to use
  the smallest one. Issue #238.
# My Build
- Autoreload feature
- Use the space better
- '-T' for title and '-d' for dmenu like output?
- If the bar is hidden when image mode, when switching modes toggle the bar (maybe bar always shown on thumbnail mode?)
