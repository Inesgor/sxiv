- Load all frames from TIFF files. We have to write our own loader for this to
  happen--just like we did for GIF images--because Imlib2 does not support
  multiple frames. Issue #241.
- Add support for more embedded thumbnail formats. Right now, sxiv seems to use
  the smallest one. Issue #238.

# My Build

- Autoreload feature  ( It needs to reload images when invoke keyhandler? the markcnt doesn't update after moving files to other directory with a keyhandler command )
- Use the space better
- '-T' for title and '-d' for dmenu like output?
- If the bar is hidden when image mode, when switching modes toggle the bar (maybe bar always shown on thumbnail mode? 	cg_toggle_bar();)
- after the padding patch I notice , I had an screenshot of my dwm bar it is really wide but not with that much height. When I mark it on thumbnail mode on some of the smalls zooms the image "dissapear" (the image was almost as thick as the marks)
- Is there a way to not navigate (to scroll) on WIDTH mode? (usefull on some memes, an comics)
- How to loop on the command 'cg_navigate_marked' ? (on marked images)
- Actual support for clipboard, I use xsel just because clipmenu use it (I don't want to fork it now but some time I will in order to work with xclip)
