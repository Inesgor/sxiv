# sxiv
My build of sxiv
![Image](Screenshot.png "Screenshot")

## Key Handler
- With the patch I made (someone who knows diff and all that please make it correct), there's no need for "modkey" to execute a command on keyhandler, pretty stuff!
- thats it?

## Fork
I use someone's fork which I don't remember why I did it, but his fork I believe is on sxiv.1

## Help...
This is really the best image viewer and prob the fastest! After my changes it's even better for me. I have one issue
- What's the best position/intuitive (preferably not with Shift, my pinky hurts) for some actions on sxiv?
- Also, is there a way to maximaze space on thumbnail mode?

Thanks and that's it ig
