.SH DESCRIPTION
sxiv is a simple image viewer for X.
.P
It has two modes of operation: image and thumbnail mode. The default is image
mode, in which only the current image is shown. In thumbnail mode a grid of

Please note, that the fullscreen mode requires an EWMH/NetWM compliant window
manager.

.SH STATUS BAR
The information displayed on the left side of the status bar can be replaced
with the output of a user-provided script, which is called by sxiv whenever an
image gets loaded. The path of this script is
.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sxiv/exec/image-info
and the arguments given to it are: 1) path to image file, 2) image width,
3) image height.
.P
There is also an example script installed together with sxiv as
.IR PREFIX/share/sxiv/exec/image-info .
.SH EXTERNAL KEY HANDLER
Additional external keyboard commands can be defined using a handler program
located in
.IR $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sxiv/exec/key-handler .
The handler is invoked by pressing
.BR "Your Binding"
In this build you can simply call the handler by the key you assing it on the executable, remember to be carefull if there's inconsitecy between the handler and config.h bindings. Passed via stdin are the
images to act upon, one path per line: all marked images, if in thumbnail mode
and at least one image has been marked, otherwise the current image.
sxiv(1) will block until the handler terminates. It then checks which images
have been modified and reloads them.

The key combo argument has the following form: "[C-][M-][S-]KEY",
where C/M/S indicate Ctrl/Meta(Alt)/Shift modifier states and KEY is the X
keysym as listed in /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h without the "XK_" prefix.

There is also an example script installed together with sxiv as
.IR PREFIX/share/sxiv/exec/key-handler .
.SH THUMBNAIL CACHING
sxiv stores all thumbnails under
.IR $XDG_CACHE_HOME/sxiv/ .
.P
Use the command line option
.I \-c
to remove all orphaned cache files. Additionally, run the following command
afterwards inside the cache directory to remove empty subdirectories:
.P
.RS
find . \-depth \-type d \-empty ! \-name '.' \-exec rmdir {} \\;
